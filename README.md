Please read through AMATH_536_Project.pdf for a summary of this project and all relevant information.

This repo originated as a research project with Professor Mamis of the University of Washington. To learn more about his research, I took his graduate level course, AMATH 536: Mathematical Modeling of Cancer. I submitted this project as the final assignment for that course.
